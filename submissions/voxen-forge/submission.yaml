  description: >
    Voxen Forge is an all-in-one Solana-first DeFi cockpit that unifies portfolio
    analytics, AI-assisted insights and seamless cross-chain swaps powered by the
    OKX DEX API, letting users monitor positions, chat with an AI copilot and move
    liquidity across 20+ chains without leaving a single interface.
  
  features:
    - "Real-time dashboard with auto-refreshing P&L, charts and token holdings"
    - "ChatGPT-style copilot that pulls price charts, trade history and on-chain data"
    - "Solana instant swap with adjustable slippage and gas-optimized execution"
    - "Bridge + swap in one transaction through OKX DEX deep liquidity"
    - "Sentiment radar that condenses social, price and volume trends into a score"

    - "Next.js"
    - "TypeScript"
    - "React"
    - "Tailwind CSS"
    - "Solana Web3.js"
    - "OKX DEX API"

  okx_dex_api_integration:
    description: >
      The app streams price quotes from the OKX DEX quote endpoint, performs route
      simulation for swap/bridge pairs via the cross-chain aggregation endpoint,
      and posts signed swap transactions directly to the OKX smart order router,
      falling back to gas-efficient splitting when liquidity is fragmented.
    features_used:
      - "Price Quotes"
      - "Cross-Chain Token Swap"
      - "Route Simulation"
      - "Order Execution"

additional:
  challenges: >
    Handling disparate chain gas models and mapping on-chain decimals required a
    dynamic schema, and syncing quote websockets with UI state without over-fetching
    demanded a bespoke request-queue with cache invalidation.
  
  future_plans: >
    Ship mobile-first PWA, add MEV-aware routing and integrate limit orders.
  
  feedback: >
    The OKX DEX API is well-documented and its cross-chain aggregation dramatically
    simplifies bridging flows; more webhook events for status callbacks would be
    helpful.
